# Emolet Trojan Malware Analysis

This document outlines the comprehensive analysis conducted on the Emolet Trojan. The analysis process is divided into three main phases: Static Analysis, Debugging, and Memory Dumping and Unmapping.

## 1. Static Analysis

**Tools Used:** IDA Pro, DIE (Detect It Easy)

**Description:**

During the static analysis phase, we performed a detailed examination of the Emolet Trojan's binary without executing it. The primary objective was to understand the structure, identify the presence of any suspicious code, and determine if the binary was packed or obfuscated.

### Steps:
- **Binary Inspection:** Using IDA Pro, we disassembled the binary to study its code structure and identify any anomalies.
- **Packing Detection:** DIE tool was employed to detect the presence of packing. Our findings revealed that the Emolet Trojan is highly packed, which is a common technique used by malware to evade detection.

## 2. Debugging

**Tools Used:** x32dbg

**Description:**

To gain deeper insights into the unpacked code and understand the Trojan's behavior, we proceeded with dynamic analysis by debugging the malware.

### Steps:
- **Setting Breakpoints:** Using x32dbg, we set breakpoints at various locations to intercept the execution flow.
- **Code Unpacking:** We carefully stepped through the execution to unpack the obfuscated code and observe the malware's functionality in a controlled environment.

## 3. Memory Dumping and Unmapping

**Description:**

After successfully unpacking the code through debugging, the next step involved dumping the memory to obtain a clean version of the unpacked executable. This process helps in analyzing the malware's actual behavior and payload.

### Steps:
- **Memory Dumping:** We dumped the process memory using x64dbg once the unpacking was confirmed.
- **File Unmapping:** The dumped memory file was then unmapped to create a standalone executable that can be further analyzed or used for signature creation.

## Conclusion

The detailed analysis of the Emolet Trojan through static analysis, debugging, and memory dumping has provided significant insights into its packed nature and underlying malicious code. This process is crucial for developing effective detection and mitigation strategies.
